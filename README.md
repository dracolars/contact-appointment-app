# Contact and Appointment Tracker
A Codecademy project

The idea for this project is to create stateful and stateless functional React components using hooks. 
This app will manage contacts and appointments. It consists of two main pages: Contacts and Appointments, each with a form to add new entries.

Live Demo: [contact-appointment-demo](https://contact-appointment-demo.netlify.app
)

The two pages each have a component that holds their form and a tilelist that displays the array of objects (either contact cards or appointments).

Each form will have validation so required fields cannot be missed, and repeted name entries for "Contacts" will not be allowed. An alert will be triggered if a duplicate name is typed or submitted.
